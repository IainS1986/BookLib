# BookLib

Simple library for use with a future Auibook App project.

Various experiments with Book APIs and Website Scraping to fetch media metadata for audiobooks to try and achieve a Plex style front end experience with audiobooks.

Testing out,

* GoodReads API
* Audible Search and Product page scraping
* GraphicAudio Search and Product page scraping
* BigFinish Search and Product page scraping
* Audiobookstore Search and Product page scraping
